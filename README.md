# AGILE_Project
Project for the course: "Agile Development"

# RULES:

## Attendance:

If a team member cannot attend a meeting or needs to leave the school during a planned work day it should be notified in the messenger chat as early as possible. When a team session has been planned, it is expected that a team member is available for the entire session, even if they need to work on other projects some of the time.

## Branch:

Each branch should represent a user story.
To merge into dev branch, one SCRUM team member must approve pull request with a code review.
The branch is always removed after a merge into dev.

## Naming conventions:
### Branch naming conventions:

Prefix: feature or fix

Convention: snake_case

Example: ```feature/upload_image```

### Commit convention:

Capital letter first

End with punctuation

First word is in present tense, for example: "Adds", "Changes", "Removes" etc.

Example: ```Adds new button to upload image.```

### Variable naming convention:

Follow language default naming convention.

### Testing guidelines

Write unit tests beforehand whenever possible. If writing tests beforehand is not possible, write the code first, and then write a test after. If test writing time exceeds what is reasonable for a task, perform manual tests instead.
